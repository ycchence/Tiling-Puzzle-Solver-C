# Tiling-Puzzle-Solver-C
This project entails implementing a program that will solve arbitrary tiling 
puzzles. The purpose of this project is to introduce a rich branch of discrete 
mathematics / combinatorics that involves tiling, symmetry, counting, solution space 
searching, branch-and-bound pruning, etc. Rotations and reflections need to be 
considered in this project.
